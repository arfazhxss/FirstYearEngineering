/*
 * PriorityQueue.java
 *
 * A priority queue interface for objects that implement the
 * Comparable interface.
 *
 * This interface considers the maximum value to be the highest priority.
 *
 * This interface isn't using generic Comparable objects because
 * one cannot (easily) create an array of a generic type in Java.
 * Generics only have compile time type checking whereas
 * arrays support runtime type checking.
 *
 * This results in compiler warnings on calls to compareTo in the
 *   linked and heap implementations that can be ignored.
 *
 * It also allows people to incorrectly insert objects of different types into
 * the same PriorityQueue.  This programming error will result in exceptions
 * being thrown at run-time.
 *
 * It is up to the programmer to only insert objects of ONE
 * type into an instance of the PriorityQueue.

     *     If q contains elements that would be accessed in the
     *     following order:  {5,3,1} after q.insert(2) returns,
     *     then q will contain elements that will be accessed
