	 * 2) Write a method named rotateLeft that takes an
	 *    array of integers and another integer n and 
	 *    returns a new array with all of the values found 
	 *    in the given array rotated left n position.
	 *
	 *    For example, given an array [9, 1, 6, 2, 3] and
	 *    n = 2, all of the elements are rotated 2 positions
	 *    left. The array returned contains: [6, 2, 3, 9, 1].
	 *    Notice the elements at the start indexes wrap around
	 *    (or "rotate") to the back of the array.

	/*
	 * 3) Write a method named longestSequence that takes an
	 *    array of integers and another integer toFind and 
	 *    returns the longest consequence sequence in the array 
	 *    that toFind is repeated. 
	 *
	 *    For example, given an array [2 2 6 2 2 2 5 5 6 2] and
	 *    toFind = 2, then 3 is returned, as there is a sequence
	 *    in the array where 2 is repeated 3 times in a row.
	 *    If toFind = 5, then 2 is returned, as the longest sequence
	 *    of repeated 5s is just 2 in a row.

	/*
	 * 4) Write a method named merge that takes two sorted
	 *    arrays of integers and creates and returns a new
	 *    sorted array containing all of the elements found 
	 *    in the two given arrays
	 *
	 *    For example, given arrays [1 2 6 8] and [3 4 7] 
	 *    a new array is returned containing: [1 2 3 4 6 7 8].
