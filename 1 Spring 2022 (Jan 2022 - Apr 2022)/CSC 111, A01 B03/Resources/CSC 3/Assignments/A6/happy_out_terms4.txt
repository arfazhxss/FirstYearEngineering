It might seem crazy what *** *** to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
*** a *** *** balloon that could go to space
*** the ***, like I don't care baby by the ***

Huh, because *** ***
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because *** ***
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because *** ***
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because *** ***
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
