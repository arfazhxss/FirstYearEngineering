It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take *** break
I'm *** *** air balloon that could go to ***
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way

Huh, because I'm happy
*** along if you feel like *** room without *** roof
Because I'm happy
*** along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
*** along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
*** along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
